# Fraud_Detection


Preprocessing notebook has the details of preprocessing while in the model building notebook preprocessing steps applied without verbose.

Preprocessing:
- Scaling amount and time features
- Random Under-Sampling
- Anomaly detection & Removing outliers
- Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering

Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree + SMOTE
- Decision Tree with undersampled data
- AdaBoost
- GradientBoosting

Model building without preprocessing notebook is there for you to see and don't use it.
